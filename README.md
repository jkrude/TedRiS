# Ted-Ed Riddle

Guarantees more time programming it than solving the problem by hand!


Finding solutions programmatically, finding similarities and having a look at the complexity and possible optimisations.
 And all while abusing an object-oriented-language for something it was never intended to be.

Different problems need different approaches:

#### SearchTree:
Searching a mapping *X → Y* under defined rules/constraints.
→ Each mapping depends on the previous mapping (candidate-list can be reduced) therefore the tree-size can be minimized.
The generator avoids exponential space through a lazy evaluation of the search tree.

#### "GridSearch"
Finding a tuple of parameters which fulfill the problem.
→ The parameters have no obvious decency's and an improvement between parameters cant be computed,
 so pure systematic try and error seems the only options.
